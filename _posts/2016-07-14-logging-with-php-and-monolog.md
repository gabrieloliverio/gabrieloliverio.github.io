In in the article
[Why should you log?](http://gabrieloliverio.github.io/2016-07-01-why-should-you-log/)
I wrote the logging benefits, what you should log and some key concepts. In this article
we will materialize logging implementing it using [Monolog](https://github.com/Seldaek)
and PHP.

Monolog is the *de facto* standard logging library for PHP and comes out of the
box in the most popular PHP frameworks, such as Laravel and Symfony.  It implements
[PSR-3](https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/accepted/PSR-3-logger-interface.md) -
a common interface for logging libraries defined by [PHP-Fig](http://www.php-fig.org).
Type-hinting `Psr\Log\LoggerInterface` in your application enables interoperability,
allowing you change the logging library for another that implements PSR-3 without
too much headache.

# Installing

Everything is easy using Composer:

```bash
composer require monolog/monolog
```

If you're not using Composer, just download
Monolog's **AND** the [PSR-3' source code](https://github.com/php-fig/log),
make it available to your application and start using it.

If you're not using namespaces (Oh man! I already did that!), you'll have a lot
of work requiring files...

# Creating loggers

This is the minimum code required to log something using Monolog:

```php
use Monolog\Logger;
use Monolog\Handler\StreamHandler;

$logger = new Logger('channel-name');
$logger->pushHandler(new StreamHandler(__DIR__.'/app.log', Logger::DEBUG));

$logger->addInfo('Hello log!');
```

That's pretty straightforward: we create a `Logger` instance, push handlers and
add the log entry, in this case, with severity `info`.

When you create a `Logger` instance, you must pass a channel name. This name is
included in every log entry and allows you to easily see and filter these entries,
creating one channel for each component or aspect of your application, for example,
channels 'database', 'router', 'security', 'business' and so on.

Loggers, by itself don't know how to handle logs, but the handlers do! You can push
how many handlers you need to a `Logger` instance and, each type of handler you
push, decide how it's going to handle the log, for example, the `StreamHandler`
in the above example, records log entries in the file system, in this case, `app.log`.
Monolog provides
[lots of handlers](https://github.com/Seldaek/monolog/blob/master/doc/02-handlers-formatters-processors.md),
that record entries in databases, send to e-mail addresses and specific platforms,
such as [Graylog](https://www.graylog.org/), [Slack](https://slack.com),
[Loggly](https://www.loggly.com) and [NewRelic](https://newrelic.com).

# Severity Levels

Severity levels describe how severe is the entry log added and, as well as the
channel name, allows you to see and filter the entries.

Monolog supports the eight severity levels described by
[RFC 5424](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5424):

- **Debug**: Detailed information used for debugging
- **Info**: Informational messages, used to record normal events
- **Notice**: Informational messages too, but used with more significant events
- **Warning**: Warning conditions, where there isn't an error yet, but you
should take an action or it will become an error
- **Error**: Error conditions, used when something definitely went wrong but
doesn't require immediate action
- **Critical**: Critical conditions, such as a system component unavailable, for
example
- **Alert**: Used for actions that must be taken immediately, waking you up
in the middle of the night
- **Emergency**: Used when the system gets unusable

An `info` log entry of a channel called 'default', for example, looks like this:

```
[2016-07-06 11:54:23] default.INFO: Hey, this is a log entry!

```

Monolog provides one `add` for each type of severity, thus, you can call
`addDebug`, `addInfo`, `addWarning` and so forth.

For detailed information about how you should use the severity levels, see
[Why should you log?](http://gabrieloliverio.github.io/2016-07-01-why-should-you-log/).

# Handler order

The order you push the handler to the `Logger` instance matters, cause whenever
you add a log entry, it will traverse the handler stack and be handled by them.
The handler's constructor have got the parameter `$bubble` which, when set to false,
stops the traversing of the handler stack. Let's see a more useful and complex
example to make things clear, using the `StreamHandler` and `SwiftMailerHandler`:

```php
use Monolog\Logger;
use Monolog\Handler\StreamHandler;
use Monolog\Handler\SwiftMailerHandler;
use Swift_SmtpTransport;
use Swift_Message;
use Swift_Mailer;

$transport = Swift_SmtpTransport::newInstance('smtp.vcela.cz', 25);
$message = new Swift_Message('A CRITICAL log was added');
$message->setFrom('noreply@vcela.cz');
$message->setTo('sara@vcela.cz');
$mailer = Swift_Mailer::newInstance($transport);

$logger = new Logger('default');
$logger->pushHandler(new StreamHandler(__DIR__.'/app.log', Logger::INFO));
$logger->pushHandler(new SwiftMailerHandler($mailer, $message, Logger::CRITICAL, false));

$logger->addCritical('Hey, a critical log entry!');
```

To use the `SwiftMailerHandler` you need to install
[SwiftMailer](http://swiftmailer.org/download).
To send e-mails through SwiftMailer, you need instances of `Swift_SmtpTransport`,
`Swift_Message` and `Swift_Mailer` as well as to bind `$mailer` and `$message`
to the `SwiftMailerHandler` instance itself.

The handling starts from the handler located at the top of the stack (pushed last),
therefore, `SwiftMailerHandler` is the first to handle the log entry, sending an
e-mail, then, the log is stored in the file system by `StreamHandler`.

Notice that we passed `false` for the last parameter of `SwiftMailer`'s constructor -
that's the `$bubble` parameter. This defaults to `true` and, when set to `false`,
stops the traversing of the handler stack, making the `StreamHandler`, located
at the bottom of the stack (pushed first), never storing logs in the file system
**IF** `SwiftMailerHandler` handle the entry.

# Context data

Context data is the information about youâ€™re logging and I wrote lots of things
about it in that article I cited twice, so, if you're interested, you know
the address :)

Monolog provides two ways of including context data in your log entries - passing an
array together the log message and using processors.

## Passing an array

This way you pass an array to the `add` method (`addDebug` or `addInfo`, for example)
after the log message:

```php
$username = 'gabrieloliverio';
$logger->addInfo('User registered', ['username' => $username]);
```

Simple, right?

## Using processors

Processors automatically include information to log entries and it's a very useful way
to add information, like session and request data - such the client's IP and browser -
to log entries of a given type. Monolog provides a
[bunch of processors](https://github.com/Seldaek/monolog/blob/master/doc/02-handlers-formatters-processors.md#processors),
but you can also create your owns, as they can be any callable that receives a parameter
corresponding the entry and return this entry, eventually changed, for example:

```php
$logger = new Logger('default');
$logger->pushHandler(new StreamHandler(__DIR__.'/app.log', Logger::INFO));
$logger->pushProcessor(function ($entry) {
    $entry['extra']['data'] = 'Hello world!';
    return $entry;
});
$logger->addInfo('User registered', ['username'=>'gabrieloliverio']);
```

This would store log entry such as the following:

```
[2016-07-06 11:54:23] default.INFO: User registered {'username':'gabrieloliverio'} {"data":"Hello world!"}
```

To use a Monolog built-in processor it's very similar, you simply use the
class and push a instance of it using the `pushProcessor` method:

```php
use Monolog\Logger;
use Monolog\Handler\StreamHandler;
use Monolog\Processor\WebProcessor;

$logger = new Logger('default');
$logger->pushHandler(new StreamHandler(__DIR__.'/app.log', Logger::INFO));
$logger->pushProcessor(new WebProcessor());

$logger->addInfo('User registered', ['username'=>'gabrieloliverio']);
```

# Formatters

Formatters can be used to customize the format of the log entries.
You can write your own formatter or just use one of the
[built-in formatters](https://github.com/Seldaek/monolog/blob/master/doc/02-handlers-formatters-processors.md#formatters)
that Monolog provides. In the following example, we will use the built-in
formatter `HtmlFormatter` to format the log sent by e-mail and, therefore,
turn into human-readable the log entry sent in the last example:

```php
use Monolog\Logger;
use Monolog\Handler\SwiftMailerHandler;
use Monolog\Formatter\HtmlFormatter;

$message = new Swift_Message('A CRITICAL log was added');
$message->setFrom('noreply@vcela.cz');
$message->setTo('sara@vcela.cz');
$message->setContentType("text/html");
$mailer = Swift_Mailer::newInstance($transport);

$logger = new Logger('default');

$mailerHandler = new SwiftMailerHandler($mailer, $message, Logger::CRITICAL);
$mailerHandler->setFormatter(new HtmlFormatter());
$logger->pushHandler($mailerHandler);

$logger->addCritical('Hey, a critical log entry!');
```

In this example, we've binded a `HtmlFormatter` object to the `SwiftMailerHandler` and
defined the `$message`'s content type to `"text/html"`. You would get an e-mail
with following body:

![alt text](http://gabrieloliverio.github.io/img/posts/monolog-html-formatter.jpg "Log record formatted as HTML")

Really nice, don't you think?

In a similar way, you can use `JsonFormatter` to encode the entry into JSON or
even to format it in a different way, without channel name, with other delimiters
and date format, for example:

```php
use Monolog\Logger;
use Monolog\Handler\StreamHandler;
use Monolog\Formatter\LineFormatter;

$logger = new Logger('default');

$format = "[%datetime%] [%level_name%] %message% [Context %context% Extra %extra%]\n";
$streamHandler = new StreamHandler(__DIR__.'/app.log', Logger::DEBUG);
$streamHandler->setFormatter(new LineFormatter($format, 'd/m/Y H:i:s')); // This date format makes much more sense for me, while brazilian :)
$logger->pushHandler($streamHandler);

$logger->addInfo('Hey mama, I'm so different!');
```

Which result in something like this:

```
[14-07-2016 12:37:48] [INFO] Hey mama, I'm so different! [Context {} Extra {}]

```

That's it for now. I hope that this article can help you start logging in your
PHP applications and enjoy its benefits. Do you want to say something?
